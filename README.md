## About this repository
This repository contains the code and resources necessary to build a chatbot using the ChatGPT model. The ChatGPT model is a transformer-based language model that has been trained on large-scale conversational data. It can be used to generate natural language responses to user input, making it an ideal choice for building a chatbot.

In this repository, you will find the code necessary to build a chatbot using the ChatGPT model. This includes code for preprocessing user input, generating natural language responses, and evaluating the performance of the chatbot. Additionally, I have included some sample datasets that can be used to train and evaluate the chatbot.

I hope this repository helps you get started with building your own chatbot using ChatGPT! If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out.
